## Introduction
This OSINT project is designed to gather and analyze publicly available information from various online sources. The goal is to provide insights and intelligence that can be used for investigative purposes, research, or security assessments.

## Features
- Data Collection: Gather data from various open-source platforms such as social media, websites, and public records.
- Data Analysis: Analyze the collected data to uncover patterns, connections, and insights.
- Reporting: Generate detailed reports based on the analysis.
- Visualization: Visualize the data with charts, graphs, and network diagrams.

## Usage

For penetration testers and security teams, OSINT aims to reveal public information about internal assets and other information accessible outside the organization. Metadata accidentally published by your organization may contain sensitive information.

For example, useful information that can be revealed through OSINT includes open ports; unpatched software with known vulnerabilities; publicly available IT information such as device names, IP addresses and configurations; and other leaked information belonging to the organization.

Websites outside of your organization, especially social media, contain huge amounts of relevant information, especially information about employees. Vendors and partners may also be sharing specific details about an organizationâ€™s IT environment. When a company acquires other companies, their publicly available information becomes relevant as well.
